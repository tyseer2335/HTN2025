Ancient trees, their bark etched with glowing runes, watched her approach.  She sought the Sunpetal, a flower said to heal her ailing grandmother.  A mischievous sprite, flitting amongst iridescent mushrooms, offered guidance, leading Elara through shimmering glades and across babbling brooks.  Finally, bathed in ethereal sunlight, she found it – a single, radiant Sunpetal, its petals pulsing with life.  Elara, her heart brimming with hope, carefully plucked the flower, its magic already warming her hands.\n",
