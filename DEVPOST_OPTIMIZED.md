# SpectraSphere - Optimized Devpost Submission

## Inspiration

**Every story deserves to be seen, not just told.**

During Hack the North, surrounded by creativity and energy, we wondered: What if stories could escape the page and live in the world around us? What if your Snapchat Memories could become immersive experiences you could actually step into?

That thought became SpectraSphere — a way to reimagine your memories, ideas, and imagination through a new lens (literally). With Snapchat Spectacles, we built an experience where your story prompts and images transform into immersive, 3D environments you can explore and interact with.

Our purpose is simple: to help people re-experience moments, or dream new ones, in vibrant and playful ways. Instead of scrolling through static images, why not step into them?

**A quote that resonated with us this weekend:**
*"The best stories are not just told—they're experienced. With SpectraSphere, your memories don't just exist in photos; they come alive in the world around you."*

## What it does

SpectraSphere transforms written or spoken prompts and images into an immersive AR storytelling experience inside Snapchat Spectacles. It's the first platform to directly integrate with Snapchat Memories, turning your saved content into living, interactive 3D environments.

**Here's how it works:**

1. **On our TypeScript web app:** Write a story prompt (or narrate it with voice input)
2. **Upload images:** Choose from your device or pull directly from Snapchat Memories
3. **AI Enhancement:** Cohere API polishes your prompt, Gemini generates styled versions
4. **One-click transfer:** SpectraSphere sends your enhanced images to Spectacles
5. **Immersive AR:** Your images appear in a rotatable 3D environment around you
6. **Style switching:** Switch between Ghibli, cyberpunk, comic, and more styles in real-time

**The magic:** Instead of just viewing photos, you can walk around them, explore them from different angles, and see them through different creative "spectra" — all in real-time.

Currently, SpectraSphere focuses on photos, but the vision doesn't stop there. We're exploring generational video so stories can become dynamic, evolving narratives that respond to your movement and interaction.

## How we built it

Our hackathon stack combines sponsor APIs, AR hardware, and a smooth frontend to create the first Snapchat Memories-to-AR pipeline:

**Frontend:** A clean TypeScript web app with voice input, image upload, and real-time generation tracking
**Cohere API:** Powers creative generation, transforming simple prompts into rich, contextual story descriptions
**Gemini 2.5 Flash Image API:** Advanced image generation and style transfer, creating multiple artistic interpretations
**Lens Studio SDK & Spectacles API:** Bridges the experience into Snapchat Spectacles with 3D positioning and real-time style switching
**Snapchat Memories Integration:** Direct sync with users' saved content for seamless workflow
**Google VO3 API (planned):** Investigating image-to-video transitions for future dynamic storytelling

**Technical Innovation:** We built a complete pipeline from static images to interactive AR experiences in under 15 seconds, with real-time style switching that maintains smooth performance on Spectacles hardware.

## Challenges we ran into

**Imagery → video transition:** One of our biggest challenges was figuring out how to elevate static images into dynamic video content. While VO3 API looks promising, hackathon time constraints forced us to get creative with GIF-style animation loops as a proof of concept.

**AR pipeline syncing:** Getting our images and prompts to flow seamlessly from frontend to Spectacles required careful coordination between multiple APIs and the Spectacles SDK.

**Real-time style switching:** Making style changes happen instantly in AR without performance drops or visual glitches was technically demanding.

**Performance optimization:** Ensuring smooth animations and interactions inside Spectacles without breaking immersion required careful rendering optimization.

**Hackathon reality:** Juggling multiple new APIs, AR development tools, and minimal sleep while pushing creative boundaries and learning Lens Studio for the first time.

**API integration complexity:** Coordinating between Cohere, Gemini, Snapchat Memories, and Lens Studio APIs while maintaining data consistency and user experience flow.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

**Creating a working end-to-end pipeline:** From typed/voiced story prompt → AI-enhanced generation → four styled images → immersive Spectacles AR experience in under 15 seconds.

**First Snapchat Memories integration:** We're the first team to successfully bridge Snapchat Memories directly to AR experiences, eliminating the need for manual uploads.

**Real-time style switching:** Getting style animations running smoothly so users can "see their stories" in different creative aesthetics without performance issues.

**Clean, intuitive frontend:** Designed a user-friendly interface that makes complex AI and AR technology accessible to anyone.

**Tackling new technologies:** Successfully integrated multiple sponsor APIs and AR SDKs for the first time, making them work together under hackathon time pressure.

**Technical innovation:** Built a complete image-to-AR pipeline that processes and renders content in real-time on Spectacles hardware.

## What we learned

**Multi-API integration:** How to coordinate between Cohere, Gemini, Snapchat Memories, and Lens Studio APIs to create a seamless user experience.

**AR development:** The ins and outs of Lens Studio and Spectacles SDK — a completely new technology stack for our team.

**Immersive storytelling:** How immersive media fundamentally changes the way we think about storytelling and user interaction.

**Performance optimization:** The importance of rendering optimization and real-time processing in AR environments.

**Creative problem-solving:** That pushing ideas into AR isn't just technical — it requires creativity, design thinking, and narrative understanding.

**Hackathon resilience:** How to adapt and pivot when facing technical challenges and time constraints while maintaining product vision.

## What's next for SpectraSphere

We see SpectraSphere as just the beginning of a new way to tell stories. Next steps:

**Enhanced Memories Integration:** Deeper integration with Snapchat Memories, automatically syncing new content to AR experiences.

**Generational video storytelling:** From static images to evolving video clips powered by VO3 and advanced AI video generation.

**Expanded style library:** More animation styles, filters, and personal aesthetic choices to match any mood or story.

**Interactive narratives:** Branching storylines and collaborative story creation with friends in shared AR spaces.

**Multi-user experiences:** Shared AR environments where multiple users can explore and interact with the same story simultaneously.

**Real-world applications:** From education to entertainment, travel storytelling to memory preservation — SpectraSphere can help people reimagine experiences across domains.

**Advanced AI integration:** Exploring more sophisticated AI models for better style transfer, content generation, and personalized storytelling.

**Platform expansion:** Bringing SpectraSphere to other AR platforms and devices for broader accessibility.
