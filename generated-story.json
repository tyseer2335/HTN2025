  "text": "Elara, a wisp of a girl with eyes like moss agates, ventured into Whisperwood, a forest humming with forgotten magic.  Ancient trees, their bark etched with glowing runes, towered over her. She sought the Sunpetal, a flower said to heal her ailing grandmother.  A grumpy wood sprite, gnarled and moss-covered, guarded the path.  He demanded a riddle's answer in exchange for passage.  Elara, recalling a forgotten lullaby, solved it.  The sprite, charmed, guided her to the Sunpetal, its petals radiating warmth, promising a cure.  Elara returned, heart brimming with hope, the forest's magic a blessing.\n",
